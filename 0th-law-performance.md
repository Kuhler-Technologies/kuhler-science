# The 0th Law of Thermodynamics and Performance

> "If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other."

This law defines how **temperature is the governing force of biological equilibrium**.

## Thermoregulation is Performance Regulation

- All energy processes (enzymatic, muscular, neural) are **temperature-dependent**
- Elevated core temperature disrupts:
  - Muscle output
  - Neural drive
  - Cognitive clarity
  - Metabolic efficiency

Kühler exists to restore thermal equilibrium — to cool the system when natural mechanisms fall short.

> Think of Kühler as a heat sink for the human machine.
