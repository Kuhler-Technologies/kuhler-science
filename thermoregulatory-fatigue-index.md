# Thermoregulatory Fatigue Index (TFI)

The Thermoregulatory Fatigue Index (TFI) is Kühler’s proprietary model for estimating heat-induced fatigue potential in athletes. It is a composite score based on ambient temperature, relative humidity, exercise intensity, and athlete characteristics (e.g., body surface area, sweat rate).

## Formula (Simplified):
**TFI = (Ambient Temp × Intensity Factor) + Humidity Modifier − Cooling Offset**

Scores:
- 0–50: Low Fatigue Risk
- 51–100: Moderate Fatigue Risk
- 100+: High Fatigue Risk – Cooling Advised

Use this index to guide mid-workout cooling interventions.
