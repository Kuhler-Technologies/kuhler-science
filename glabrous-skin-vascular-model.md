# Glabrous Skin and Heat Transfer

Glabrous skin (palms, soles, face) contains arterio-venous anastomoses (AVAs), which act as direct radiators of heat from the core.

## Key Characteristics:
- High blood flow rate
- Dense AVA network
- Large thermal gradient to environment

Targeted cooling of glabrous skin can accelerate systemic heat dissipation, improving endurance and delaying fatigue.
