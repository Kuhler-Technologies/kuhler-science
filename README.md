# KÃ¼hler Science Repository

Welcome to the official KÃ¼hler repository for the science, physiology, and performance data behind palm cooling and thermoregulation. This resource is designed to share first principles, protocols, and validation data on how managing core temperature enhances athletic output, recovery, and resilience.

We believe that **temperature is the ultimate limiter of human performance**, and that thermoregulation is the next frontier in human optimization.

This repo includes:

- Scientific foundations (0th Law of Thermodynamics)
- Anatomy and physiology of glabrous skin cooling
- Heat stress fatigue mechanisms
- Data from KÃ¼hler validation trials
- Use protocols for athletes and coaches
- Frequently asked questions about palm cooling and performance
