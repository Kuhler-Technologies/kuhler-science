# Why Palm Cooling Works

The palms contain dense **arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs)** — direct shunts between arteries and veins that act as the body's radiator system.

### Key Facts:

- Palms are glabrous (non-hairy) skin optimized for heat transfer
- AVAs open during heat stress to dump warm blood through the skin
- Cooling this region rapidly reduces core body temperature

But not all cooling is equal.

If the cooling surface is too cold, AVAs shut down (vasoconstriction). Kühler uses **precise thermoelectric regulation** to cool without triggering this effect.

> Palms = radiator  
> Kühler = intelligent, on-demand radiator amplifier
