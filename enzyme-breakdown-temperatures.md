# Enzymatic Breakdown at Elevated Temperatures

Key metabolic enzymes begin to denature or lose efficiency above 39–40°C.

| Enzyme           | Optimal Temp | Breakdown Temp |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Pyruvate Kinase  | 37°C         | ~40°C          |
| Lactate Dehydrogenase | 37°C     | ~41°C          |
| Myosin ATPase    | 36–38°C      | >40°C          |

By preventing core temp rise, Kühler preserves metabolic efficiency during training.
