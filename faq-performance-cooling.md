# Kühler: Performance Cooling FAQ

### Does it feel cold?
Yes — newer versions were redesigned to improve perceptual cooling without sacrificing physiological effect.

### Why is this better than cold towels or ice?
Those cause vasoconstriction and trap heat. Kühler avoids this while maintaining precise temp range.

### How long do I use it?
1–2 minutes is often enough to reduce thermal fatigue markers.

### Does this replace hydration or ice baths?
No — it **supplements** them. But unlike ice baths, you can use Kühler mid-workout or mid-competition.

### Is there any science behind this?
Yes — see our [validation data →](./kuhler-validation-data.md) and [physiology pages →](./why-palm-cooling.md)
