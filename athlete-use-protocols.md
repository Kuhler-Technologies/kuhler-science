# Athlete Use Protocols

Kühler use varies by sport and intensity. Here are baseline protocols:

## ⚡ CrossFit / Hyrox

- Use between sets or WODs
- Duration: 60–90 seconds per hand
- Ideal for short recoveries where fatigue builds fast

## 🏋️ Strength / Powerlifting

- Use during rest periods between heavy sets
- Enhances rep consistency and volume over time

## 🏃 Endurance / Intervals

- Use post-run or between high-heat intervals
- Ideal for restoring cognitive clarity + output

**Note:** No ice, water, or prep needed. Just grab and cool. Immediately effective.
