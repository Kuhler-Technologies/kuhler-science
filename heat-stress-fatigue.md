# Heat Stress and Fatigue

Fatigue isn't just about glycogen or lactic acid — it's often about **temperature**.

## Mechanisms:

- **CNS Inhibition**: High core temps cause central fatigue (lower neural drive)
- **Enzymatic Breakdown**: Key metabolic enzymes (like pyruvate kinase) denature around 40°C
- **Cognitive Load**: Reduced cerebral blood flow + increased impulsivity = poor decision-making
- **Cardiovascular Strain**: Competition between muscles and skin for blood flow

Cooling the body delays or eliminates these constraints — keeping athletes in the performance zone.
