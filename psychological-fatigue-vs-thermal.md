# Psychological vs. Thermal Fatigue

Thermal fatigue can induce psychological symptoms including:
- Reduced motor unit recruitment
- Lowered mood/motivation
- Cognitive slowness
- Decision-making errors

Research shows thermal stress can increase perception of effort even when physiology remains unchanged. Palm cooling mitigates this disconnect.
