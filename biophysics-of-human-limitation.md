# The Biophysics of Human Limitation

Performance is constrained by:
- **Energy systems**
- **Heat buildup**
- **CNS inhibition**

As biological systems work, heat is an inevitable byproduct. Without effective heat removal, performance degradation is unavoidable.

Kühler acts as a thermodynamic gateway — turning ambient air into a functional heat sink.
