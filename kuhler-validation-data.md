# Kühler Validation Data

Two internal trials tested the ergogenic effects of Kühler on training volume in heat-stressed conditions.

## Trial A: Single-Hand Cooling

Push-up reps to failure increased on cooling sets by:
- Set 6: +20%
- Set 8: +32%
- Set 10: +38%
**→ 28% average performance gain**

## Trial B: Two-Hand Cooling

- Set 6: +37%
- Set 8: +24%
- Set 10: +47%
**→ 35% average performance gain**

## Conclusion

Even brief, targeted palm cooling with Kühler offsets thermal fatigue and extends muscular output. No prep, no downtime — just **pure thermodynamic advantage**.
